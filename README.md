# consulting-website

Minimal Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold created locally.

Local setup
```powershell
# 1) Install Node.js (LTS) and npm
# 2) Install dependencies and run dev server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create the GitHub remote and push
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/jcollins-devops/consulting-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

Edit the site content
- Replace the placeholder text in `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/layout.tsx` with your background and contact details.

Notes
- You currently need Node.js installed to run the project locally.
- If you want me to create the GitHub repo for you, provide a PAT with `repo` scope or install the `gh` CLI and authenticate, and I can run the creation command for you.
